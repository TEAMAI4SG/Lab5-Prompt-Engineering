# Lab 5: Prompt Engineering for Social Good

---

## üìò Introduction

This lab delves into the world of AI tokenization, a cornerstone of language models like those developed by OpenAI, with a special focus on its application for social good. By understanding how to segment text into tokens‚ÄîAI's basic unit of understanding‚Äîwe explore not just the mechanics but also the ethical implications of token economy. Through practical exercises, we'll discover how optimized token use can contribute to more sustainable and accessible AI solutions, driving positive change in society.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

- **Understand Tokenization**: Comprehend the significance of tokenization in AI language processing and the impact of token economy on scalability and cost.
- **Apply FACTORS**: Utilize the FACTORS mnemonic to engineer precise prompts, ensuring that each component ‚Äî Format, Action words, Context, Tone, Output, Role, and Specific items to avoid is optimized to guide the AI's output towards actionable insights.
- **Promote Social Good**: Integrate the principles of prompt engineering to address real-world problems, specifically focusing on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), to conceptualize AI-driven solutions for societal benefit.
-**Evaluate and Refine**: Critically assess and refine prompts to reduce token usage without compromising on quality, enhancing your ability to create economically and ethically sound AI interactions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 1.1 What is Prompt Engineering

1. Prompt Engineering is the new term for the process of structuring words and sentences for generative artificial intelligence models to be able to understand. It is important to have specific prompts that reflect the needs of the user in order to gain a satisfactory output from generative AI. In the following sections, we will go over some effective prompt engineering techniques and examples of prompts that can obtain satisfactory outputs from AI.

Here are some basic prompt engineering techniques **(FACTORS)**: 
1. **Format of Response**: specify the level of detail, the brevity, and overall format of the response you wish to receive. 
2. **Action Words**: use action words throughout your prompt to guide the AI‚Äôs content generation.
3. **Context**: offer background information to frame your prompt within a specific scenario/goal.
4. **Tone and Formality**: define the style and seriousness appropriate for the intended audience.
5. **Output**: provide an example output to illustrate your expectations.
6. **Role**: clarify the model‚Äôs assumed identity, profession, expertise, etc to shape its response. 
7. **Specific Items to Avoid**: Identify any content that should be excluded from the AI's responses.

## üï∫ Let‚Äôs Break it Down

Here is a sample prompt for a financial analysis of 2024 cryptocurrency trends:

*Prepare a brief report as a financial analyst, focusing on the cryptocurrency market trends from Q1 2024. List the top 5 investment risks and opportunities, ensuring to omit legal considerations. The response should be in a bullet-point format suitable for an investment strategy meeting. For example, you might start with 'Risk: Volatility ‚Äì Cryptocurrencies have shown significant price fluctuations...'*

Let's delve deeper into this prompt‚Äôs construction to find where various prompt techniques have been utilized for a more precise response.
