# Lab 5: Prompt Engineering for Social Good

---

## üìò Introduction

This lab delves into the world of AI tokenization, a cornerstone of language models like those developed by OpenAI, with a special focus on its application for social good. By understanding how to segment text into tokens‚ÄîAI's basic unit of understanding‚Äîwe explore not just the mechanics but also the ethical implications of token economy. Through practical exercises, we'll discover how optimized token use can contribute to more sustainable and accessible AI solutions, driving positive change in society.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 1.1 What is Prompt Engineering

1. Prompt Engineering is the new term for the process of structuring words and sentences for generative artificial intelligence models to be able to understand. It is important to have specific prompts that reflect the needs of the user in order to gain a satisfactory output from generative AI. In the following sections, we will go over some effective prompt engineering techniques and examples of prompts that can obtain satisfactory outputs from AI.

Here are some basic prompt engineering techniques **(FACTORS)**: 
1. **Format of Response**: specify the level of detail, the brevity, and overall format of the response you wish to receive. 
2. **Action Words**: use action words throughout your prompt to guide the AI‚Äôs content generation.
3. **Context**: offer background information to frame your prompt within a specific scenario/goal.
4. **Tone and Formality**: define the style and seriousness appropriate for the intended audience.
5. **Output**: provide an example output to illustrate your expectations.
6. **Role**: clarify the model‚Äôs assumed identity, profession, expertise, etc to shape its response. 
7. **Specific Items to Avoid**: Identify any content that should be excluded from the AI's responses.

## üï∫ Let‚Äôs Break it Down

Here is a sample prompt for a financial analysis of 2024 cryptocurrency trends:

*Prepare a brief report as a financial analyst, focusing on the cryptocurrency market trends from Q1 2024. List the top 5 investment risks and opportunities, ensuring to omit legal considerations. The response should be in a bullet-point format suitable for an investment strategy meeting. For example, you might start with 'Risk: Volatility ‚Äì Cryptocurrencies have shown significant price fluctuations...'*

Let's delve deeper into this prompt‚Äôs construction to find where various prompt techniques have been utilized for a more precise response.

By dissecting this prompt, we can better understand how each component contributes to creating a clear, focused, and effective request for AI-generated content. Remember, the quality of the input significantly influences the quality of the output.

Now it‚Äôs your turn! Please analyze the following prompt by identifying the prompt technique being used at each bracketed number in Table 1. Identify which of the FACTOR element(s) are used and elaborate.

Imagine you are a [1] **data analyst**. You have been given a [2] **dataset about the recent trends in renewable energy adoption across various countries**. Your [3] **task is to identify the top three countries with the highest increase in solar energy usage over the last five years**. Please present the findings in a [4] **concise bullet-point list**, using the data provided.

## üõ†Ô∏è 1.3 Prompt Engineering for Social Good

Now that you‚Äôve been introduced to some basic examples of prompt engineering, how might we connect this to the real world to build solutions for social good? Select one UN SDG and come up with a practical application of generative AI that is different from the example provided in class (ICW). Then, craft a prompt for this practical application, integrating the prompt engineering techniques we learned. Be sure to clearly indicate where you use each technique by placing the corresponding numbers in square brackets []!

Here are the **FACTORS** prompt engineering techniques from Part 2.1 for your reference: 

1. **Format of Response** ‚Äî specify the level of detail, the brevity, and overall format of the response you wish to receive. 
2. **Action Words** ‚Äì use action words throughout your prompt to guide the AI‚Äôs content generation.
3. **Context** ‚Äî offer background information to frame your prompt within a specific scenario/goal.
4. **Tone and Formality** ‚Äî define the style and seriousness appropriate for the intended audience.
5. **Output** ‚Äì provide an example output to illustrate your expectations.
6. **Role** ‚Äî clarify the model‚Äôs assumed identity, profession, expertise, etc to shape its response. 
7. **Specific Items to Avoid** ‚Äî Identify any content that should be excluded from the AI's responses.

Here‚Äôs an example to get you started (we‚Äôve omitted the output for brevity, but please include it for yours):

**UN SDG**: #1 No Poverty
**Usage**: Lesson plan writing to teach students practical skills for the workplace

**Prompt**: You are a [6] life skills teacher and you [3] need a lesson plan for your upcoming class. In a [1] bullet point format, [2] list some important skills that one needs to learn to effectively survive in the workplace. Be sure to explain each skill and give examples on how they are needed for the workplace. [7] Omit anything overly technical and have this lesson plan [4] aimed for students going to a variety of workplaces.

Now it‚Äôs your turn! **Make a copy of your Colab file used in Lab 2a: Generating Text with OpenAI‚Äôs Models**.

**UN SDG**: 
**Usage**: 
**Prompt**: 


**Output from Colab**: 

Table 4. Writing prompt for UN SDGs

As an advanced move (optional), consider how you might implement these strategies with Lab 2b, the image generation lab. Now try it out! Be careful of possible additional costs ‚Äì as we saw before, generating images is more expensive than generating text.

## üß© 2.1 Tokenization? What‚Äôs That?

**Tokenization** is a fundamental concept in utilizing AI language models, including those developed by OpenAI. It's the process of converting text into smaller pieces, called tokens, which the model can interpret and process.

**Why is understanding tokenization important?** Different prompts consume different token amounts, which in turn cost us different amounts of money. Although text-based prompts often cost only a fraction of a cent, think about businesses which process thousands of prompts per hour. Eventually, these cost differences can accumulate, making it crucial to optimize token count.
